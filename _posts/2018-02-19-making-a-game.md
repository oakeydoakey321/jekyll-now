    <td>I could have got more done in the lesson time, so as not to save all the work for my lunchtimes and at home. I also could have used more complex code, not just basic code which just makes the game work.</td>

    <td>I should not talk to other people,because that means I will lose concentration and do less work than others. I should try to reach out and do expanded learning, like finding other ways of coding on the internet.</td>
